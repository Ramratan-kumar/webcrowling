On 5/27/2022 the two chairs and loveseat were delivered. The loveseat was damaged. Mathis Home agreed to take the loveseat back and bring a new one when they delivered the sofa. These items were delivered on June 28.  No estimated delivery date on the other pieces. In September I contacted the salesperson and she decided to contact OKC for advice as 4 months had passed. Mathis Home delivered the items on September 27. Attached are photos. The table top had hinges hanging so that the leaf can not be locked. There were various scratches and dents in the table top. The cabinet handles were worn. The cabinet hinges were pulled off. The set was used or demo. They agreed to redeliver. The best part is that when they get the furniture in your home that is when you pay for the furniture. So I have used furniture that I paid new prices for even though they agreed it's bad and they need to replace it. They sent a new set on December 27,2022. The delivery crew was high af. That set was also damaged. The cabinet was caved in on the side. The delivery guys banged the cabinet into the existing table and scratched it. The chairs wobbled. Mathis Home agreed that they would replace the items. The delivery truck swept out nails and screws in my driveway and tracked mud all through my house. They delivers again on March 20, 2023. Damaged again. We just refused the delivery.  Again they delivered on April 10, 2023. Unusable furniture. We refused the delivery. We have a new delivery scheduled for May 8, but the table top has to be brought from California or Ontario. For 6 deliveries, my husband and I have taken off work 6 days. They have offered to give us 15% off if we accept tThe furniture as is. If I wanted used furniture, I would have gone to Facebook Marketplace instead of Mathis Home.

I just keep getting run around. They agreed that there was extensive damage to the dresser and it arrive with all sorts of putty filler that looks horrible. They can't replace the dresser because the line has been discontinued. They sent someone out to access the damage and he said it was bad but there was nothing he can do to fix it. They offered a 10% refund which is insulting. The bottom line here is they have done nothing and don't even bother to reply to my emails.

The best part is that when they get the furniture in your home that is when you pay for the furniture. So I have used furniture that I paid new prices for even though they agreed it's bad and they need to replace it. They sent a new set on December 27,2022. The delivery crew was high af. That set was also damaged. The cabinet was caved in on the side. The delivery guys banged the cabinet into the existing table and scratched it. The chairs wobbled. Mathis Home agreed that they would replace the items. The delivery truck swept out nails and screws in my driveway and tracked mud all through my house. They delivers again on March 20, 2023. Damaged again. We just refused the delivery.  Again they delivered on April 10, 2023. Unusable furniture. We refused the delivery. We have a new delivery scheduled for May 8, but the table top has to be brought from California or Ontario. For 6 deliveries, my husband and I have taken off work 6 days. They have offered to give us 15% off if we accept tThe furniture as is. If I wanted used furniture, I would have gone to Facebook Marketplace instead of Mathis Home.

These items were delivered on June 28.  No estimated delivery date on the other pieces. In September I contacted the salesperson and she decided to contact OKC for advice as 4 months had passed. Mathis Home delivered the items on September 27. Attached are photos. The table top had hinges hanging so that the leaf can not be locked. There were various scratches and dents in the table top. The cabinet handles were worn. The cabinet hinges were pulled off. The set was used or demo. They agreed to redeliver. The best part is that when they get the furniture in your home that is when you pay for the furniture. So I have used furniture that I paid new prices for even though they agreed it's bad and they need to replace it. They sent a new set on December 27,2022. The delivery crew was high af. That set was also damaged. The cabinet was caved in on the side. The delivery guys banged the cabinet into the existing table and scratched it. The chairs wobbled. Mathis Home agreed that they would replace the items. The delivery truck swept out nails and screws in my driveway and tracked mud all through my house. They delivers again on March 20, 2023.

These items were delivered on June 28.  No estimated delivery date on the other pieces. In September I contacted the salesperson and she decided to contact OKC for advice as 4 months had passed. Mathis Home delivered the items on September 27. Attached are photos. The table top had hinges hanging so that the leaf can not be locked. There were various scratches and dents in the table top. The cabinet handles were worn. The cabinet hinges were pulled off. The set was used or demo. They agreed to redeliver. The best part is that when they get the furniture in your home that is when you pay for the furniture. So I have used furniture that I paid new prices for even though they agreed it's bad and they need to replace it. They sent a new set on December 27,2022. The delivery crew was high af. That set was also damaged. The cabinet was caved in on the side. The delivery guys banged the cabinet into the existing table and scratched it. The chairs wobbled. Mathis Home agreed that they would replace the items. The delivery truck swept out nails and screws in my driveway and tracked mud all through my house. They delivers again on March 20, 2023. Damaged again. We just refused the delivery.  Again they delivered on April 10, 2023. Unusable furniture. We refused the delivery. We have a new delivery scheduled for May 8, but the table top has to be brought from California or Ontario. For 6 deliveries, my husband and I have taken off work 6 days. They have offered to give us 15% off if we accept tThe furniture as is. If I wanted used furniture, I would have gone to Facebook Marketplace instead of Mathis Home.

They haven't communicated with me at all. I have to keep calling and asking about it. I will NEVER shop here again. Also, the chairs I got are already fraying. Poor quality. Poor customer service. Poor decision on my part to shop there."},{"reviewer_name":"Laurie K.","rating":1,"date":"2022-06-29","comment":"came into store found chair over 2000,000 ordered and paid for it was to be delivered today almost a month to the day.

No one will even take our phone call or respond to messages.  Don't even THINK about talking to the store manager.  In the meantime we ordered two barstools which they forgot to notify us  came in so we had to track those down.  Then we ordered an end table and coffee table and the \"coffee table\" arrived with only the glass, no base.  Not to worry, though - they could get the base here by SEPTEMBER.  Thankfully our salesman intervened and got them to sell us a floor model.  They have zero customer service and you'd do far better just to drive to Dallas."},{"reviewer_name":"Michelle H.","rating":1,"date":"2023-01-04","comment":"I do not recommend the Tulsa store and the customer service is horrible. And when I call back I just get the runaround and excuses that this person's in Mexico or this person only works on Wednesday that would handle your situation etc. etc. I went in on 10 December picked out some furniture, Purchased it for a later delivery date.  Called the next morning and canceled everything. I had written them at $4900 check which they had said they had already processed and here we are on January 3 and I still don't have my refund. How would you feel if a store had $4900 of your money.???  And I've called several times and no one has helped and no one has resolved this issue and no one seems to care."}]}
